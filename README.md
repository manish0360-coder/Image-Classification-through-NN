# Image Classification Through Neural Network

This project implements image classification from scratch using a Neural Network.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to understand how a neural network works internally by
building and training a simple image classifier.

This project also includes:
- Comparison between 1 hidden layer vs 2 hidden layers
- Overfitting analysis
- Training and evaluation using real data

## Used
- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
- image_classification_neural_network.ipynb → Main notebook

## What I Learned
- How forward and backward propagation works
- Effect of model complexity on overfitting
- How more hidden layer impact learning
