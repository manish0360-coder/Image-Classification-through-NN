# Image Classification Through Neural Network

This project implements image classification from scratch using a Neural Network.

## Description
The goal of this project is to understand how a neural network works internally by
building and training a simple image classifier.

The project also compares:
- 1 hidden layer vs 2 hidden layers
- Overfitting behavior

## Used
- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib

## File
- Image_classification_NN.ipynb
